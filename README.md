# Introduction

Welcome to my Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project! There are a lot of moving parts at LIGO, so in this project, we will focus on my work on gravitational waveform "classification," or "binning"!

I worked with LIGO to research ways to improve the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detection instrument. My job was to analyze and categorize different kinds of (purely theoretical) gravitational waveforms using raw characteristics identified by the 'GSTlal' Python library. My ultimate goal was to figure out if I could group these waveforms in a way that would make the instrument even more sensitive to real-life detections.

What does that all mean? If you're confused, read on. I will explain everything—from theory to implementation—in great detail.


# Background

LIGO is a large physics experiment that detects, and conducts research on, gravitational waves. These waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as merging black holes or neutron stars. During my reserach, I focused on detecting gravitational wave signatures from "intermediate mass black holes," which are a certain mass-class of black hole that emit waves for a specific duration, and at specific evolving frequency ranges.

LIGO consists of two detectors located in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana. These detectors use lasers and mirrors to measure the extremely small changes in distance that result from the passage of a gravitational wave.

Increasing the sensitivity of LIGO's detectors is critical because it allows scientists to detect gravitational waves from increasingly distant sources. This, in turn, allows them to study a wider range of celestial objects and phenomena, including some that may be too far away or too faint to be observed in other ways.

Because the scales involved are so extreme, scientists and engineers at LIGO are constantly trying to find new ways to increase the sensitivitiy of the instrument.

# Instrument Sensitivity

At these simultaneously extreme microscopic and microscopic scales, instrument sensitivity depends a lot on the precision and quality of your hardware and your software. A lot can chan

# The Software

GstLAL **(Generalized s-transform Time-domain LIGO Algorithm Library)** is a software package developed by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) used to analyze data from LIGO's gravitational wave detectors.

One of the main uses of GSTLAL is to compare the data off the detector to how we'd expect gravitational waveforms to show up on the detector, and looking for matches or correlations between the two.

GSTLAL includes a number of tools and algorithms that are specifically designed to optimize the search for gravitational waves. For example, it includes tools for generating theoretical templates, for filtering and conditioning the data, and for calculating statistical significance.

# Binning

Waveform binning is a technique that is used to group gravitational waveforms into categories or bins based on certain characteristics or features. This can be useful for a number of purposes, such as improving the efficiency of gravitational wave searches, or for classifying gravitational waves based on their source or other properties.

In the context of GSTLAL, waveform binning is used to improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave searches by allowing analysts to focus on specific regions of the parameter space where gravitational waves are more likely to be found. By binning the waveforms according to certain features, analysts can reduce the number of templates that need to be searched and thereby increase the speed and efficiency of the analysis.

Waveform binning can be performed using a variety of methods, such as clustering algorithms or machine learning techniques. The specific method used will depend on the goals of the analysis and the characteristics of the data.

Overall, waveform binning is a useful tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of gravitational wave searches, and it is an important part of the analysis process in GSTLAL.

In the context of LIGO and GSTLAL, the parameter space refers to the vast multidimensional space that represents the possible values of the parameters that describe a gravitational wave signal. These parameters may include the masses and spins of the objects that generated the wave, the distance to the source, and the orientation of the wave relative to the detector.

However, there are sensitivity-efficiency tradeoffs involved in binning, as it can potentially reduce the sensitivity of the detection if it leads to the loss of important information or the neglect of certain regions of the parameter space. To minimize this sensitivity loss, it is important to choose a binning method and parameters that are appropriate for the specific goals of the analysis and the characteristics of the data.

There are several ways to minimize sensitivity loss when using binning, such as choosing a binning method that preserves as much information as possible, or using multiple rounds of binning with progressively finer bin sizes. It is also important to carefully consider the tradeoffs between sensitivity and efficiency and to choose a binning strategy that strikes a good balance between the two.

The way we reduce sensitivity loss is though the algorithm that we choose to bin.
